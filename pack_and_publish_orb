# For the first publish or to create a dev version:
circleci orb publish packed_orb.yml leecookson/tf-scripts-orb@dev:alpha

# To promote a dev version to a semantic version (e.g., 1.0.0):
# circleci orb publish promote leecookson/tf-scripts-orb@dev:alpha patch
# circleci orb publish promote leecookson/tf-scripts-orb@dev:alpha minor
# circleci orb publish promote leecookson/tf-scripts-orb@dev:alpha major
# Or directly publish a new semantic version if you are sure:
# circleci orb publish packed_orb.yml leecookson/tf-scripts-orb@1.0.0
